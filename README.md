# Hasher

Welcome to Hasher my SHA512 implementation in **rust**.

This is a fun project that I also made since I hash files a lot and prefer to do it on my own.

# How to build?

To build and install to:

```
cargo install --path . --profile release
```
NOTE: Do the command above inside the project directory.

Then for run do:

```
hasher
```

Or if you want everything in one command:

```
cargo run --release
```
