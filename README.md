# Hasher

Welcome to Hasher my SHA512 implementation in **rust**.

This is a fun project that I also made since I hash files a lot and prefer to do it on my own.

# How to build?

To build do:

```
cargo build --release
```
Then for run do:

```
./target/release/hasher
```

Or if you want everything in one command:

```
cargo run --release
```
